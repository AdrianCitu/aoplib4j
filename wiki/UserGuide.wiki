=== Introduction ===
This page describes how to use/weave the aoplib4j aspects into your own projects.


==== Weave aspects at runtime using "load time weaving" (LTW) ====
  * download aoplib4j 
  * add in the project classpath the {{{aoplib4j-x.x.x.jar}}} and {{{ascpectjrt.jar}}} 
  * compile your project
  * enable LTW of aspects by executing your application with the -javaagent:pathto/aspectjweaver.jar

For more details about LTW please refer to the [http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/devguide/ltw-configuration.html#enabling-load-time-weaving The AspectJ Development Environment Guide - chapter 5]

==== Weave aspect at compile time using ajc compiler ====
  * download and install AspectJ
  * download aoplib4j
  * compile your project code with ajc (AspectJ Compiler); use the {{{-aspectpath pathto/aoplib4j-x.x.x.jar}}} compiler option to weave the aoplib4j aspects into the project code.

For the full list of ajc options please refer to the [http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/doc/released/devguide/ajc-ref.html The AspectJ Development Environment Guide - chapter 2]
